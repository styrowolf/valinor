    /// Replaces the tile stored at the designated location

    /// # Data race safety
    ///
    /// The implementation takes the following steps to ensure data race safety:
    ///
    /// - Acquires a lock at the start of the call, ensuring that calls to [`DirectoryGraphTileProvider::get_tile_containing`]
    ///   block until this method exits.
    /// - Writes to a temporary file initially, so if anything goes wrong, the original file is not affected.
    ///   After successfully writing the temp file, it is atomically renamed on top of the original.
    /// - Clears the internal tile cache (local to _this_ [`DirectoryGraphTileProvider`] instance!)
    ///   once the rename succeeds.
    /// - Releases the lock, unblocking access to this tile, only after everything succeeds,
    ///   or fails mid-write (in which case, only the temporary file is affected).
    ///
    /// In this way, a (single!) [`DirectoryGraphTileProvider`] should be safe to use in async contexts,
    /// without fear of races from writers.
    /// Additionally, since readers always have to wait for a writer to finish,
    /// readers will never get a partially written tile, nor will they get a stale tile
    /// if there is an open write operation.
    ///
    /// ## Edge cases
    ///
    /// Once you have a handle to a graph tile from [`DirectoryGraphTileProvider::get_tile_containing`],
    /// the lock is freed and a writer may then proceed.
    /// Your handle will _not_ change or block writers,
    /// creating an opportunity for edge cases (especially if you plan to create a builder from this tile
    /// to write changes!).
    ///
    /// So, if your workload involves both reads and writes,
    /// **you _must_ ensure that your tile references cannot be stale.**
    /// This probably means some sort of partition mutex in your processing loop.
    ///
    /// Additionally, if the write operation fails, your graph tile builder is gone.
    /// The original file on disk is not in a dirty state, but to retry again,
    /// the caller would need to reconstruct the same builder from scratch.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// This function may fail in a variety of cases that are returned as errors:
    ///
    /// - The tile was explicitly constructed with an invalid graph ID
    /// - The graph tile builder is invalid (see [`GraphTileBuilder::into_byte_iter`] for details)
    /// - Writing the temporary file fails
    /// - The atomic file rename fails
